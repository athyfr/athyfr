# Me!

## Introduction

Hi!

I'm currently in high-school (grade 10), working away towards my graduation.

Excited by the FOSS world, and obsessed by computer-science, I hope to create all the best software I can!

I've got some big ambitions for the future (for after graduation), and am quite strong in ideation, but you'll have to wait for that. (I could use a mentor, though.)

## Current Projects

My biggest projects I'm currently working on are:
- A video game in Godot, which I hope to publish on Itch, Game Jolt, and Steam. It's a pixel-platformer, *but with a twist!*
- Setting up an ecommerce store (Linux Devices.ca). I'm already in contact with a few suppliers, so things are looking good!
- Putting a few procedural Blender assets on sale. I made these, so they should be something good to profit from. I plan to open their sources, of course!

But besides that, I put most of my time to school. Information is quite valuable, I understand!
