## Introduction

Hi!

I'm currently in high-school (grade 10), working away towards my graduation.

Excited by the FOSS world, and obsessed by computer-science, I hope to create all the best software I can!

## Current Projects

My biggest projects I'm currently working on are:
- Setting up an **ecommerce store** (Liberty Devices.ca). I hope to increase the accessibility of Linux devices.
- Learning and creating in Godot, including development of a more flexible local multiplayer system.

But besides that, I put most of my time to school. Information is quite valuable, I understand!

If you want to support any of these projects, feel free to donate:

Soon I'll have some wallpapers and such on sale on Ko-Fi, and you could purchase those to support me as well!

## What I Use

Mainly, the software I currently use is:
- **[NixOS.](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)** My favourite Linux distribution. _I've seen the beauty of Nix!_
- **[KDE Plasma 6.](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop#plasma-desktop)** Nothing else seems quite as flexible, even if it's buggy at times.
- **[Librewolf.](https://codeberg.org/librewolf/source#librewolf-source-repository)** Perhaps best _privacy-oriented_ browser packaged in Nix right now (Is [Waterfox](https://github.com/BrowserWorks/Waterfox?tab=readme-ov-file#waterfox) better?). though when it's stable I may move to [Ladybird.](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird?tab=readme-ov-file#ladybird)
- **[Zed editor.](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed?tab=readme-ov-file#zed)** My code editor of choice. State-of-the-art, growing, and with most common features.
- **[Freeplane.](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane?tab=readme-ov-file#freeplane)** A wonderful program for note-taking and planning.
- **[Inkscape.](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape#inkscape-draw-freely)** I use this whenever I need an icon or graphic, though I may eventually migrate to [GodSVG.](https://github.com/MewPurPur/GodSVG)
- **[Godot.](https://github.com/godotengine/godot?tab=readme-ov-file#godot-engine)** For game development. The alternatives (Unity and Unreal Engine) are proprietary, and I've found Godot quite easy to use.
- **[LibreOffice.](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core?tab=readme-ov-file#libreoffice)** For whenever I need to make a document. Also, LibreOffice Draw is the best I know for making flow-charts and such.
