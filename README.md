# Athyfr's README

## Introduction

Hi!

I'm currently in high-school (grade 10), working away towards my graduation.

Excited by the FOSS world, and obsessed by computer-science, I hope to create all the best software I can!

I've got some big ambitions for the future (for after graduation), and am quite strong in ideation, but you'll have to wait for that. (I could use a mentor, though.)

## Current Projects

My biggest projects I'm currently working on are:
- A **video game** made in Godot, which I hope to publish on Itch, Game Jolt, and Steam. It's a pixel-platformer, _but with a twist!_
- Setting up an **ecommerce store** (Linux Devices.ca). I'm already in contact with a few suppliers, so things are looking good!
- Putting a few **procedural Blender assets** on sale. I made these, so they should be something good to profit from. I plan to open their sources, of course!

But besides that, I put most of my time to school. Information is quite valuable, I understand!

## What I Use

Mainly, the software I currently use is:
- **[NixOS.](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)** My favourite Linux distribution. _I've seen the beauty of Nix!_
- **[KDE Plasma 6.](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-desktop)** Nothing else seems quite as flexible, even if it's buggy at times.
- **[Waterfox.](https://github.com/BrowserWorks/Waterfox)** Perhaps best _privacy-oriented_ browser right now, though when it's stable I may move to [Ladybird.](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird)
- **[Zed editor.](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)** My code editor of choice. State-of-the-art, growing, and with most common features.
- **[Freeplane.](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane)** A wonderful program for note-taking and planning.
- **[Inkscape.](https://github.com/inkscape/inkscape)** I use this whenever I need an icon or graphic, though I may eventually migrate to [GodSVG.](https://github.com/MewPurPur/GodSVG)
- **[Godot.](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)** For game development. The alternatives (Unity and Unreal Engine) are proprietary, and I've found Godot quite easy to use.
- **[LibreOffice.](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core)** For whenever I need to make a document. Also, LibreOffice Draw is the best I know for making flow-charts and such.
